📈 Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data to assess the damage caused by the pandemic across different countries. The analysis examines infection rates, death counts, vaccination progress, and population-adjusted impact metrics.

🔍 Focus Areas

Data Transformation: Cleaning and restructuring raw COVID-19 data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Identifying trends and patterns in infections, deaths, and vaccinations.

Visualization: Creating insightful visuals to highlight the pandemic's global impact.

📊 Tableau Dashboard

I also developed a [Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/priti.chaudhari/viz/CovidDataVisualizationDashboard-May2024_17551213558610/Dashboard1) to visualize Covid-19 infection data across all the countries around the world. The dashboard gives an overview of the global death count, continental death count, and a filtered view of percentage population infected by country.
